      <p className="text-info">Hello! I think one of the most interesting projects to improve as a frontender is to create your own design system.
  In this project my purpose is to create different components whose characteristics help me discover new things or improve my skills.</p>
      <p className="text-info">The main objective of this project is the implementation of elements using React (I understand that the styles could be improved and I promise to work on it in the future ðŸ™‡). The philosophy to follow is that these elements can be used together or separately. (eg graphs are made up of other elements such as axes that can be used independently).</p>
